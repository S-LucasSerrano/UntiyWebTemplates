# UntiyWebTemplates
These are the WebGL templates I use in my Unity web games.

I mainly use the ``Simple Full Page`` template as I think it works best for itch.io. Allowing you to control the game size and add a maximize button directly from the itch project settings.

### Usage
To use a web template in Unity, add any of the folders in this repo -each containing a different template- to the ``Assets/WebGLTemplates`` folder of your project.

**And thatâ€™s it!**

It will now appear in the player settings alongside the minimal and default templates. Chose the one you like and build your game.
